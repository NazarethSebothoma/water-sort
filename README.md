# water-sort
My code seizes the power of data stuctures to develop a console version of water sort puzzle game.
A water sort puzzle game is a puzzle whereby the player has to sort the liquids in bottles depending on their colours.
There are 5 bottles to use.
The game is complete if three bottles are filled, with each bottle being filled with one color.
I used java as my programming language.
